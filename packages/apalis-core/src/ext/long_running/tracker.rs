/// A task tracker used for waiting until tasks exit.
///
/// This is usually used together with a cancellation mechanism to implement graceful shutdown.
/// The cancellation mechanism is used to signal to tasks that they should shut down, and the
/// `TaskTracker` is used to wait for them to finish shutting down.
///
/// The `TaskTracker` will also keep track of a `closed` boolean. This is used to handle the case
/// where the `TaskTracker` is empty, but we don't want to shut down yet. This means that the
/// [`wait`] method will wait until *both* of the following happen at the same time:
///
///  * The `TaskTracker` must be closed using the [`close`] method.
///  * The `TaskTracker` must be empty, that is, all tasks that it is tracking must have exited.
///
/// When a call to [`wait`] returns, it is guaranteed that all tracked tasks have exited and that
/// the destructor of the future has finished running.
///
/// # Features
///
/// The `TaskTracker` provides several unique features:
///
///  1. When tasks exit, a `TaskTracker` will allow the task to immediately free its memory.
///  2. By not closing the `TaskTracker`, [`wait`] will be prevented from returning even if
///     the `TaskTracker` is empty.
///  3. A `TaskTracker` does not require mutable access to insert tasks.
///  4. A `TaskTracker` can be cloned to share it with many tasks.
///
/// The first point is important for long-running applications. If you keep inserting tasks and
/// never remove them, their metadata could accumulate and consume memory. With a `TaskTracker`,
/// once tasks exit, they are immediately removed from the `TaskTracker`.
///
/// Note that dropping a `TaskTracker` does not abort the tasks.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ## Spawn tasks and wait for them to exit
///
/// ```
/// use task_tracker::TaskTracker;
///
/// async fn example() {
///     let tracker = TaskTracker::new();
///
///     // Track some futures
///     for i in 0..10 {
///         let future = async move {
///             println!("Task {} is running!", i);
///         };
///         // You would spawn this with your preferred executor
///         // executor.spawn(tracker.track_future(future));
///     }
///     
///     // Once we spawned everything, we close the tracker.
///     tracker.close();
///
///     // Wait for everything to finish.
///     tracker.wait().await;
///
///     println!("This is printed after all of the tasks.");
/// }
