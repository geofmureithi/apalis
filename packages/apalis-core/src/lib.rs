//! # apalis-core
//! Utilities for building background task processing tools.
//!
//! `apalis-core` provides foundational types and traits for building distributed, asynchronous background task processing systems.
//! It enables defining, scheduling, and monitoring tasks in a modular and extensible way.
//!
//! ## Concepts
//!
//! ### Request
//! A [`Request<Args, Context>`] represents a unit of work to be executed by a worker. It contains:
//! - `args`: the input to the task (e.g., an email to send).
//! - `parts`: metadata such as the task ID, execution attempts, state, backend context, and extensions.
//!
//! You can construct requests using:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use apalis_core::request::Request;
//! struct BackendContext;
//! let req = Request::new_with_ctx("send-email", BackendContext);
//! ```
//!
//! ### WorkerBuilder
//! [`WorkerBuilder`] provides a fluent API to configure workers with middlewares, filters, and error handling strategies.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use apalis_core::worker::WorkerBuilder;
//!
//! let worker = WorkerBuilder::new("my-worker")
//!     .layer(my_middleware)
//!     .build_fn(handler);
//! ```
//! ### Worker
//! A [`Worker`] represents a task processor. It polls tasks from a [`Backend`], sends them to a [`Service`], and handles retry logic, timeouts, and state transitions.
//!
//! Workers can be created manually or using a [`WorkerBuilder`] for more fluent composition.
//!
//! ### ServiceFn
//! A [`ServiceFn`] is an adapter that turns an async function into a task [`Service`]. This is useful for injecting lightweight task handlers.
//!
//! Example:
//! ```rust
//! use apalis_core::service_fn;
//!
//! let handler = service_fn(|req: String, worker: WorkerContext | async move {
//!     println!("Processing task: {:?}", req);
//!     Ok(())
//! });
//! ```
//! ### Monitor
//! A [`Monitor`] supervises multiple [`Worker`]s, supports graceful shutdowns, and coordinates global signals like shutdown or restart
//!
//! Example:
//! ```rust
//! use apalis_core::{monitor::Monitor, worker::Worker};
//!
//! let worker = WorkerBuilder::new("my-worker")
//!     .layer(my_middleware)
//!     .build_fn(handler);
//! Monitor::new().register(worker).run().await;
//! ```
